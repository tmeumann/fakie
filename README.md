# fakie â€“ the flaky web proxy

An HTTP proxy for testing web apps under flaky network conditions. Can be configured to drop:

- the first _n_ attempts to send each request;
- the first _n_ attempted responses from each request; and/or
- a percentage of requests and/or responses at random.

No automated tests were used, but also no vibes. Use at your own risk.

A [moymoy.dev](https://moymoy.dev) project.

## Usage

Ensure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) installed, then install fakie using cargo:

```shell
cargo install fakie
```

Run `fakie --help` for CLI usage.
